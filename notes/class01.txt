Steps to create Framework:
Add the dependencies to POM.xml
Reload project
Delete main folder
Add directory recourses under TEST folder
Create config and features directories under recources
Under config create config.properties file (used for key value pair important info(url/browser/etc))
Under feature folder create Login.feature file (u can name is differently)
Add steps to your feature file (
Feature: Login Feature

  Scenario: user enters correct credentials and is able to login
    Given  user navigates to the website

    And user clicks on login button
    Then user is successfully logged in
)
Under Java create utils, steps and runners directories
Under utils create CommonMethods ConfigReader and Constants classes
Add common methods that we already have in a different project to CommonMethods class
Same with Constants, add them from a different project to Constants class
Also add config reader code from a different project to ConfigReader class
Add runner class under runners directory and copy it from a different project
To generate step definitions set dryRun to true and run the runnerClass
Copy the step definitions that generated and paste them into the  â€”>
Create the LoginSteps class under steps directory  and paste generated definitions here
Start writing the java code into the generated definitions
